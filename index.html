                        The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. It belongs to a family of viruses that may cause various symptoms such as pneumonia,
                        fever, breathing difficulty, and lung infection. These viruses are common in animals worldwide, but very few cases have been known to affect humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) used the term 2019 novel coronavirus to refer
                        to a coronavirus that affected the lower respiratory tract of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, China on 29 December 2019. The WHO announced that the official name of the 2019 novel coronavirus is coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
                        And the current reference name for the virus is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was reported that a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a local Huanan South China Seafood
                        Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. </p>
                    <p>In response to the outbreak, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) dispatched a rapid response team to accompany health authorities of Hubei province and Wuhan city to conduct epidemiological and etiological
                        investigations. The WHO confirmed that the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic was associated with the Huanan South China Seafood Marketplace, but no specific animal association was identified. Scientists immediately started to
                        research the source of the new coronavirus, and the first genome of COVID-19 was published by the research team led by Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang, on 10 January 2020. Within 1 month, this virus spread quickly throughout China during
                        the Chinese New Year – a period when there is a high level of human mobility among Chinese people. Although it is still too early to predict susceptible populations, early patterns have shown a trend similar to Severe Acute Respiratory
                        Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Susceptibility seems to be associated with age, biological sex, and other health conditions. COVID-19 has now been declared as a Public Health Emergency
                        of International Concern by the WHO.

                        <b>How does the virus spread? Can it be in food?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        Coronavirus spreads mainly through droplets in the air. The virus can also be found on contaminated surfaces, and end up infecting someone after they touch the surface and then touch their face. (Whether coronavirus meets the definition of “airborne”
                        is a matter of debate among scientists.) The reason we’re distancing ourselves at 6 feet (2 meters) or more is because, generally speaking, this is the range that will keep you protected if an infected individual is coughing or
                        sneezes—and therefore spreading droplets with coronavirus through the air. Ideally you’d want to stay farther away, but 6 feet is a minimum. According to the FDA, there is currently no evidence that coronavirus transmission occurs
                        through food. Keep up with the same steps you normally take to prevent foodborne illnesses. According to Harvard Medical School’s Coronavirus Resource Center, people who are infected with coronavirus but not showing symptoms can
                        still spread the virus. Aerosolized droplets containing the virus can still exit the body through breaths and speech and float through the air, infecting healthy individuals. Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus. Contact
                        tracing has also been an aggressive tool in tracking down potentially sick individuals and testing and isolating them.

                        <b>Can infections cause permanent effects and complications?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        Yes. Many patients who come down with covid-19 pneumonia experience acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a form of respiratory failure where the lungs are suddenly overwhelmed by inflammation and unable to deliver oxygen to the body’s vital organs.
                        ARDS has a mortality rate of 30 to 40 percent and is the leading cause of covid-19-related deaths. There isn’t a whole lot of literature about what happens if you survive ARDS, but long-term lung damage is a possibility, especially
                        for older individuals. UK doctors report that lung damage sustained by ARDS survivors may take 15 years to heal. Hong Kong doctors told the South China Morning Post that they witnessed some covid-19 survivors see a 20 to 30 percent
                        drop in lung function after recovering from infection. If PCR tests are so easily contaminated, how sure are we about the accuracy of the case numbers? Should we be suspicious? PCR is a gold standard platform for testing. Even
                        a tiny amount of virus in a patient sample can be found and amplified for detection and testing. That doesn’t mean the test is fool-proof. Yes, the reagents can be easily contaminated—which is precisely what botched the CDC’s initial
                        rollout of coronavirus tests in February. But that’s why there are control tests that are used to ensure the entire platform is running as it should. The problem with the CDC’s February tests were that the negative controls were
                        faulty—which was almost immediately made known. There is no real reason to be suspicious of PCR tests for diagnosing coronavirus.It’s probably the most accurate testing platform we have for diagnosing covid-19.

                        <b>How does coronavirus affect pregnancy?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        At this time, there is no evidence to suggest being pregnant increases your risk for getting coronavirus, or that your risk of developing severe symptoms increases with pregnancy. According to the CDC, there is no increased risk of miscarriage with covid-19.
                        We don’t have much data on whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect infants, and the limited data we have, according to Harvard Medical School, the vast majority of mothers with covid-19 gave birth to babies who showed no clinical evidence
                        of infection. There is also no evidence of the virus infecting breastmilk. Expecting mothers should practice safe hygiene and social distancing at this time, and should also speak with their healthcare providers if they have any
                        specific questions. Have restrictions and lockdowns prevented flu transmission and deaths as well? The 2019-2020 influenza season saw a steady decline in numbers throughout the month of March. According to the CDC, the number of
                        clinical cases testing positive for flu decreased from 24.3 percent at the end of February, to 2.1 percent for the week ending in March 28. That’s not exactly surprising, as numbers always tend to decline as we near April. But
                        the drop has been pretty sharp. It’s too early to say whether social distancing measures are responsible and how great of a role they played. Other factors involved include the effectiveness of the vaccine and how many people got
                        it, how infectious the flu was this year, and how rigorously people were tested (and whether the covid-19 pandemic played a role in incentivizing testing). We won’t know for sure until epidemiologists get a chance to look over
                        the data.

                        <b>Does Covid-19 really cause a loss of smell and taste?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        On March 20, scientists with ENT UK, a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat doctors, reported that the loss of smell and taste seemed to be a symptom of coronavirus infections, based on anecdotal reports from colleagues around the
                        world. The authors wrote that it seemed 30 percent of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Korea experienced anosmia (loss of smell) “as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases.” In Germany, anosmia was reported by
                        two-thirds of Covid-19 patients. And the truth is, it’s not entirely surprising. Post-viral anosmia is the cause of 40 percent of all cases where someone loses their sense of smell. The ENT UK statement says previously studied
                        coronaviruses cause anosmia in 10 to 15 percent of all infections. Although it’s a normal part of many viral infections, the reason anosmia is a concern for Covid-19 is because it’s often presenting itself in very mild infections,
                        in the absence of more severe symptoms like fever, coughing and shortness of breath. These are people who aren’t really presenting as ill in any significant way, so they may not be self-isolating themselves as they should. But
                        before we jump to conclusions, we need to wait for published data that shows without a doubt anosmia is a symptom of Covid-19. If you’re experiencing a loss of smell and taste these days, it’s not a definitive sign that you have
                        coronavirus. But it might be a sign that you should be extra vigilant about self-isolating, and perhaps seek out a Covid-19 test (if it’s available).

                    <p>
                        <b>How does this end?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        Nobody knows. Epidemiologists at Imperial College London suggest we could see a worst-case scenario of 264 million Americans infected and 2.2 million dead. We also don’t know some important things about the virus, including how many asymptomatic cases
                        there are, making it difficult to plan. After the outbreak in Wuhan became public in late December, Chinese authorities began enforcing strict measures on travel and activity designed to stop the spread of the virus as aggressively
                        as possible. It seems to be working: China reported no new cases in Wuhan on March 15. Strict measures are said to have helped reduce the number of new infections in hard-hit places like South Korea as well. Unfortunately, for
                        every South Korea or Singapore, there’s a case like Italy, which did not handle the initial outbreak well and is now reeling from the effects, with the virus spreading incredibly fast and taxing health-care systems well beyond
                        capacity. That’s part of the reason we don’t know how this will end—we don’t yet have a system of containing the virus that is universally adhered to around the world. Just last week, the UK was suggesting it would forgo strict
                        mandates on social distancing and isolation, and instead take a slow approach that would allow over 60% of its population to become infected in order to encourage herd immunity. The about-face on this policy may have come too late.
                        The pandemic could reach a natural end when it finally spreads to nearly every part of the world and no longer has anywhere else to go. But that would leave an unthinkable number of people dead. We could see a combination of various
                        antiviral treatments being fast-tracked sooner to help treat cases, and continued efforts to help slow the spread and “flatten the curve” (more on that below). But the solution that saves the most lives is a vaccine that provides
                        immunity. That will probably take another 18 months to develop, and there’s no telling yet how effective it might be.

                        <b>How is a quarantine supposed to work?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        The idea behind quarantine is to isolate people who are or may be infected, in order to prevent them from transmitting the illness to others, or to sequester healthy people and make sure they stay healthy. If you restrict someone’s movements beyond the
                        incubation period of the infection, you can isolate new cases as they come up, prevent the spread of infection, and treat those who fall sick. CDC researcher examined flu cultures CDC There’s some elasticity in what qualifies as
                        a quarantine. Not being allowed to leave home, or being kept in isolation within a hospital, are pretty strict forms. Sometimes quarantines are not mandatory, but self-imposed by individuals who think they might be sick and doing
                        the right thing by waiting out the incubation period (or recovering from illness) before going out in public again. Quarantines are only one of a list of actions that can be taken to increase social distancing and help “flatten
                        the curve”—limit the number of cases at any one time, so the peak caseload is much easier for health-care systems to manage.

                        <b>How fast can coronavirus mutate?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        Mutations are natural to every gene on the planet, including those that are part of viruses. In fact, we can study these mutations in the coronavirus genome itself to see whether outbreaks in a single country are related. So far, it appears the rate of
                        mutation in coronavirus is less than half the rate of eight to 10 times per month for influenza. And more specific numbers will come as researchers spend more time studying the virus. It’s harder to say how specifically we can
                        use this information. Multiple genetic mutations are required for a virus to evolve into something more virulent or threatening. Current research suggests the two major strains of coronavirus affecting humans differ by just 0.007%.
                        There’s no reason to think a vaccine developed for one won’t work against the other.

                        <b>If you survive coronavirus once, can you be reinfected?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        There are a few reports so far that individuals who’ve contracted the disease and been cleared of the virus have tested positive again. So far these seem to be extremely rare —in China they seem to account for less than 0.2% of all infections. Other literature
                        shows that scientists have observed persistent infections of coronaviruses in animals. We still don’t know enough about the virus or about how immunity develops after infection to say much about how this might work. Thus far it
                        seems rare enough not to be alarmed about. And most scientists seem to think errors more likely explain why some recovered patients are testing positive.

                        <b>What should we expect as spring arrives? Will the warm weather hurt or help our efforts to stop the virus?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        A big question scientists are trying to answer is whether coronavirus peaks during the winter and ebbs during the summer, like the flu. If there’s a seasonal aspect to the virus, then it also means we have to plan for levels of infection in the Northern
                        Hemisphere to rise rapidly as autumn sets in. The answer is unclear. A new study that hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet suggests that 95% of positive cases globally have thus far occurred between -2 and 10 °C, which could indicate
                        greater transmission in cooler climates. The prospect of seasonality is already influencing how some countries are approaching the problem. The UK’s maligned former strategy to encourage herd immunity assumed in part that the country
                        needed to plan for keeping its health-care system from being overwhelmed by peak caseloads in winter. Yet so many different variables can influence transmission. We’ve only known about the virus for a few months and have yet to
                        actually observe what will happen as the seasons change. The virus may just barrel through the summer unimpeded, or it may exhibit stranger behavior in the winter. We need more data to make strong predictions.

                        <b>How long are people contagious when they are infected?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        The answer depends on the study you read. A recent study by German scientists suggests that people who test positive are most contagious before they’ve started exhibiting symptoms and during the first week that symptoms show up. Symptoms can appear anywhere
                        between two and 14 days after infection. On the plus side, the same study shows that after about eight to 10 days of symptoms, patients were no longer infectious. This seems to show that though the disease is pretty contagious
                        at the onset, the body gets rid of the virus quickly once antibody production turns on (which is typically within six to 12 days). Yet another study, however, suggests the virus can endure in the body for a median of 20 days after
                        infection, and as long as 37 days in some cases. The rule of thumb being promoted so far is to remain quarantined for 14 days from the moment you develop symptoms.

                        <b>What are the core health and medical tools, technologies, and resources we need to handle thousands or tens of thousands of cases in cities and towns around the US? Why haven’t we scaled up production?</b></br>
                        </br>
                        One of the biggest concerns facing health-care systems down the road is the availability of medical ventilators for hospitalized patients. Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, and for those severely affected, it's critical to be able to provide oxygen or
                        mechanical help with breathing. The US has only 160,000 ventilators available at the moment—a fraction of what we may need if the virus hits harder. Current business models are just not designed to incentivize this level of manufacturing,
                        though there are efforts to change that right now. But by far, the biggest immediate need is testing kits. “We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in
                        a press briefing Monday. Unfortunately, the US simply hasn’t been testing enough people, and it’s almost a certainty there are many more infections than cases that have been confirmed. Production is ramping up now thanks to new
                        efforts by private and academic labs, but might be too late. Down the road, we’ll also need to figure out how to scale up manufacturing of antiviral treatments or even a viable vaccine.
